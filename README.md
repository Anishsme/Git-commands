# Git-commands
git clone <repo-link>=Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.

git branch <branch-name>=for creating, listing and deleting branches.
  Viewing branches:git branch or git branch --list
  Deleting a branch:git branch -d <branch-name>
 
git status=The Git status command gives us all the necessary information about the current branch. 
  
git add=When we create, modify or delete a file, these changes will happen in our local and won't be included in the next commit
 
git commit -m "commit message"=Git commit is like setting a checkpoint in the development process which you can go back to later if needed. We also need to write a short message to explain what we have developed or changed in the source code

git push <remote> <branch-name>=After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote repository.
  
 git pull <remote>=The git pull command is used to get updates from the remote repo
