git add=When we create, modify or delete a file, these changes will happen in our local and won't be included in the next commit
 
git commit -m "commit message"=Git commit is like setting a checkpoint in the development process which you can go back to later if needed. We also need to write a short message to explain what we have developed or changed in the source code
